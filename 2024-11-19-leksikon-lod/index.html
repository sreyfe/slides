### From Leksikon to LOD: Towards Biographical Information Extraction 
Jonah Lubin, Marco Antonio Stranisci<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em;" -->

---

#### Motivation

Any Yiddish scholar can tell you: Yiddish cultural workers are underrepresented on the internet.

--

We wanted to work on two things:
1. Quantify this underrepresentation
2. Help to correct for it		

--

- But the problem is:
	- Yiddish NLP tools are relatively poor
		- OCR is bad compared to other languages
	- and most comprehensive biographical sources for Yiddish writers etc. are in Yiddish

--

#### The Solution 

- <em>Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur</em> (Biographical Dictionary of Modern Jewish Literature)
	- published by Congress for Jewish Culture between 1956 and 1981

![leksikon](images/leksikon.jpg)<!-- .element height="350px;" -->

--

- translation by Josh Fogel
	- first published on [Blogspot](https://web.archive.org/web/20180507060624/http://yleksikon.blogspot.ca/)
	- Now on the Congress for [Jewish Culture website](https://congressforjewishculture.org/lexicon)

--
- Each page of the blog is a translated biographical entry of a Jewish (primarily Yiddish) cultural actor

--

#### Scraping
- Blogspot was scraped in October, 2023
	- now no longer accesible
- 5,807 biographies scraped

---

#### First question: how bad is the underrepresentation?

- How many of the people in the <em>Leksikon</em> could be identified on Wikipedia?

--
#### Let's use Relik!
[![relik](images/relik.png)](https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/relik)

--
- Project of Sapienza NLP
	- dedicated to fast and efficient entity linking and relation extraction
- Uses a Wikipedia knowledge base

--
#### Entity linking
- Feed Relik first five sentences of each entry
	- get potential candidates
- which are then evaluated against the name of the subject in order to see if it is a potential match
	- fuzzy Token Sort Ratio
	- if score above 80, they are selected
- Then these potential matches are manually evaluated

#### Example input

Ash, Sholem
November 1, 1880 – July 10, 1957

Born in Kutne (Kutno), Poland, according to his birth certificate—it was January 1; according to his mother’s reckoning—four days after Passover. His father, Rabbi Moyshe Gombiner, came from a family of ritual slaughterers and was something of a scholar as well as a philanthropist. He did business in sheep and also ran a hotel. His mother, Malka, née Vidovski, the second wife of his father and much younger, came from a scholarly family in Lentshits (Łęczyca). He was raised at home “between two worlds”: on one side his full brothers—tall, healthy youngsters who did business with butchers and Gentiles and loved life’s adventures (they later moved to the United States and made their way there).<!-- .element: style="text-align:justify;font-size:0.6em;" -->

#### Fuzzy search
<p>
Poland :  19<br>
Kutno :  10<br>
Sholem Asch :  85<br>
Edwin B. Astwood :  33<br>
Mútne :  11<br>
Polish People's Republic :  26<br>
etc. etc.
</p><!-- .element: style="text-align:justify" -->

--

#### Results
- With this method, we have identified 117 out of 5,807 bibliographies
- This would imply that few of these people are present on Wikipedia

--

- There are indeed problems with the fuzzy search
- But even if this method captures only 1/10th of the people on Wikipedia,
there are still thousands of entries from the <em>Leksikon</em> not on Wikipedia
	- Serious knowledge gap

---
#### Second question: how can we correct the underrepresentation?

--
In the case of the Leksikon: how do we go from unstructured to structured biographical data?

--
Biographical event recognition, for one

Stranisci, M. A., Damiano, R., Mensa, E., Patti, V., Radicioni, D., & Caselli, T. (2023, July). WikiBio: a Semantic Resource for the Intersectional Analysis of Biographical Events. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers) (pp. 12370-12384).<!-- .element: style="text-align:justify;font-size:.7em" -->

--
#### Most popular events

![events](images/events.png)

--
#### Event extraction to triplets
- Would be good to be able to link these as predicates between subject and object
	creating triplets for use in structured data
- Many of these events are difficult to automatically interpret
	- what are the objects for serve, remain, active, take part, etc.?
