### From Leksikon to LOD: Towards Biographical Information Extraction 
#### A progress report
Jonah Lubin (Harvard University), Marco Antonio Stranisci (University of Turin)<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em;" -->

### Table of Contents
- Motivation
- Part I: How can we quantify the underrepresentation of Yiddish intellectuals on the internet?
	- "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways..."
- Part II: How can we improve the situation?
	- "...the point is to change it."

--

#### Motivation

Any Yiddish scholar can tell you: Yiddish people/places/things are underrepresented on the internet.

--

We wanted to work on two things:
1. Quantify this underrepresentation
2. Help to correct for it		

--
#### Part I: How can we quantify this underrepresentation?

--

#### General idea:

- What percentage of the total number of Yiddish intellectuals is represented on the internet?
	- Intractable problem
- Easier question: from a definite corpus of Yiddish intellectuals, how many are on Wikipedia?

--

- But resources are limited, since:
	- Yiddish NLP tools are relatively poor
		- OCR is bad compared to other languages
	- and most comprehensive biographical sources for Yiddish writers etc. are in Yiddish
	- So what corpus can we use to check the represantation of Yiddish writers on Wikipedia?

--
#### The Solution

- <em>Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur</em>, translated by Josh Fogel
	- first published on [Blogspot](https://web.archive.org/web/20180507060624/http://yleksikon.blogspot.ca/)
	- Now on the Congress for [Jewish Culture website](https://congressforjewishculture.org/lexicon)

![lexicon](images/lexicon.png)<!-- .element height="350px;" -->

--


#### The Solution 

- <em>Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur</em> (Biographical Dictionary of Modern Jewish Literature)
	- Published by Congress for Jewish Culture between 1956 and 1981
	- Eight volumes of Yiddish biographies

![leksikon](images/leksikon.jpg)<!-- .element height="250px;" -->

--
![leksikon yid](images/leksikon_yid.png)<!-- .element height="600px;" -->

--
- Each page of the blog is a translated biographical entry of a Jewish (primarily Yiddish) cultural actor
![lateiner](images/lateiner.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--
- Widely used, important resource
- Helps bring attention to understudied people
	- e.g. Urke Nachalnik


![urke](images/urke.jpg)<!-- .element height="250px;" -->

---

#### New question:
- What percentage of the biographies from the <em>Leksikon</em> are present on Wikipedia?

--

#### First, we scrape
- Blogspot of the <em>Leksikon</em> was scraped in October, 2023
	- now no longer accessible
- 5,807 biographies scraped

--

#### Then we use Relik
[![relik](images/relik.png)](https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/relik)

--
- Project of Sapienza NLP
	- dedicated to fast and efficient entity linking and relation extraction
- Uses a Wikipedia knowledge base

--
#### Entity linking

- Use Relik's entity linking to match <em>Leksikon</em> people with Wikipedia entries
1. Feed Relik first five sentences of each entry
2. Extract potential candidates
3. Manually evaluate

--
#### Example input

Ash, Sholem
November 1, 1880 – July 10, 1957

Born in Kutne (Kutno), Poland, according to his birth certificate—it was January 1; according to his mother’s reckoning—four days after Passover. His father, Rabbi Moyshe Gombiner, came from a family of ritual slaughterers and was something of a scholar as well as a philanthropist. He did business in sheep and also ran a hotel. His mother, Malka, née Vidovski, the second wife of his father and much younger, came from a scholarly family in Lentshits (Łęczyca). He was raised at home “between two worlds”: on one side his full brothers—tall, healthy youngsters who did business with butchers and Gentiles and loved life’s adventures (they later moved to the United States and made their way there).<!-- .element: style="text-align:justify;font-size:0.6em;" -->

#### Fuzzy matching
<p>
Poland :  19<br>
Kutno :  10<br>
Sholem Asch :  85<br>
Edwin B. Astwood :  33<br>
Mútne :  11<br>
Polish People's Republic :  26<br>
etc. etc.

#### Results
- With this method, we have identified 117 Wikipedia for the of 5,807 bibliographies
	- ca. 2%
- This implies that few people in the <em>Leksikon</em> are present on Wikipedia

--

- There are indeed problems with the fuzzy search
	- Anyone have a better idea?
- Nonetheless, even if this method only captured 1/10th of the <em>Leksikon</em> people represented on Wikipedia,
there are still thousands of entries from the <em>Leksikon</em> not on Wikipedia
	- Serious knowledge gap

---
#### Part II: How can we correct the underrepresentation?

--
In the case of the Leksikon: how do we go from unstructured to structured biographical data?

--
Biographical event recognition, for one

Stranisci, M. A., Damiano, R., Mensa, E., Patti, V., Radicioni, D., & Caselli, T. (2023, July). WikiBio: a Semantic Resource for the Intersectional Analysis of Biographical Events. In Proceedings of the 61st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers) (pp. 12370-12384).<!-- .element: style="text-align:justify;font-size:.7em" -->

--
#### WikiBio

- biographical event recognition, by Stranisci et al.
- used to create World Literature Knowledge Graph
- investigate representation of "transnational" authors on Wikipedia:

![transnational](images/transnational.png)

--

#### WikiBio: Most popular events

![events](images/events.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--
#### WikiBio: Problem

- Only does event recognition
- I.e. does not capture the object of a biographical triple
	- Radvodzki <b>left</b> Lithuania

--
#### Then perhaps Relik?

- Relation extraction!
	- Captures full triplets
- But doesn't capture what Wikipedia/WikiData does not already know
	- Only uses WikiData properties
	- Especially a problem with migrational predicates, since WikiData doesn't model this well

--
#### Solution:

We need open information extraction in order not to reproduce the canonical topics/models.

--
#### In other words:

- If we're not careful, models can be procrustean beds which reproduce normative structures

![procrustes](images/procrus.jpg)


---
## Future work

--

#### Biographical open information extraction

- Produce a model which extracts subject/predicate/object triplets independent of pre-existing ontologies
- In order to do this:
	- Annotated corpus of 1000 translated Yiddish biographies
	- Especially focusing on tricky predicates (e.g. migration)

[![aequa](images/aequa.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->](https://label.aequa-tech.com/annotators/tasks/46/text_lines/4369)


--
#### Goals:
- Event detection/relation extraction which escapes existing structures
- Produce structured Yiddish biographical data which can be made accessible as Linked Open Data
