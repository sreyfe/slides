--

#### Scraping
- Blogspot was scraped in October, 2023
	- now no longer accesible
- 5,807 biographies scraped

--

#### Entity linking
- First five sentences of each entry were fed to [Relik](https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/relik)
	- Project of Sapienza NLP
	- dedicated to fast and efficient entity linking and relation extraction
- Uses a Wikipedia knowledge base
- Motivation: to see how many of the people in the <em>Leksikon</em> could be identified on Wikipedia

--

#### Entity linking
- Potential candidates are produced by Relik
- These are then evaluated against the name of the subject in order to see if it is a potential match
	- fuzzy Token Sort Ratio
	- if score above 80, they are selected
- Then these potential matches are manually evaluated

--

#### Results
- With this method, we have identified 117 out of 5,807 bibliographies
- This would imply that few of these people are present on Wikipedia
