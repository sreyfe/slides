## Yiddish Digital Humanities
### Some examples

### TOC

1. What are Digital humanities?
	- Generally
	- What are the forerunners of Yiddish DH?
2. Project run\-down

	- [Mapping Yiddish Publishing](https://sreyfe.github.io/mapping_yiddish_publishing/)
	- [Random Forverts bot](https://x.com/random_forverts)
	- [YiDraCor](https://dracor.org/yi)
3. [iberz: a database of Yiddish translations](http://iberz.org)

---

### 1. What are Digital humanities?
- Like "Comparative Literature," an anxiogenic term
	- a la René Wellek
- A very broad term for many approaches
- Many ways to answer, hence [What Is Digital Humanities](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/)

--

### Digital, digitized, and numerical humanities, according to Roth

- <em>Digitized humanities</em>: emphasizes the constitution, management, and processing of digitized archives
- <em>Numerical humanities</em>: emphasizes mathematical abstraction and the development of numerical and formal models
- <em>Humanities of the digital</em>: emphasizes computer-mediated interactions and online communities

<small>cf. Camille Roth: Digital, digitized, and numerical humanities. In: Digital Scholarship in the Humanities 34.3 (2019), S. 616–632. ([doi:10.1093/llc/fqy057](https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqy057))</small>

--
### Three Sphere Model

![Sahle](images/Patrick_Sahle_-_Mapping_DH_de.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->
<small>Model (first published 2013, updated 2021) by Patrick Sahle, Bergische Universität Wuppertal. This and previous slide stolen from [Frank Fischer](https://lehkost.github.io/slides/2023-04-20-einf-dh/#/1/3).</small>

--

- What interests me most is Computational Literary Studies (CLS)
	- aforemention digitized and numerical humanities
	- Humanistic study with digital tools
	- as opposed to the humanistic study of digital content

--
### DH according to Krämer
- Krämer argues that DH is not in the hermeneutic tradition of the humanities, but in the diagrammatic
- Wants to deprivilege hermaneutics and interpretation as "the royal road and gateway of traditional humanities"
- Instead, emphasizes 'cultural technique of flattening'
	- the projection of complex relations onto an artificial flatness

--
Krämer seeks a numerical heritage for the humanities in the

"the dating of letters, books, and documents, of designing catalogs of works, concordances, and keyword indexes." (Krämer)

<small>“Should We Really ‘Hermeneutise’ the Digital Humanities? A Plea for the Epistemic Productivity of a ‘Cultural Technique of Flattening’ in the Humanities. | Published in Journal of Cultural Analytics.”</small>

--
she writes:

"Alphabetically structured corpora of information make knowledge intersubjectively addressable and accessible: encyclopedia, lexicons, dictionaries, but also library catalogs, concordances, and keyword indexes as well as the private note boxes of scholarly work utilize the epistemic functions of alphabetical sorting. The alphanumeric draws on artificial flatness." (Krämer)

--
### Keyword indexes
![scholem](images/index.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--

### Dictionairies
![bdb](images/bdb.jpg)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--

### Bibliographies

![bashevis bib](images/bashevis_bib.jpg)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

---

### So what are Yiddish digital humanities?
	- How can we construct a genealogy?

--

### The lexicographic tradition, for one
![lexicography](images/lexicography.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--

Ex. 1: Stutchkoff's <em>Oytser</em>
![oytser](images/oytser.png)<!-- .element height="600px;" -->

--
- Stutchkoff: actor, playwright, composer, lexicographer
- In 1931 he published a rhyming dictionary for Yiddish (ייִדישער גראַמען־לעקסיקאָן)
- best known for the <em>Oytser</em>, published in 1950 and edited by the Yiddish linguist Max Weinreich
- 930 pages, 620 semantic fields
	- from זײַן (being) to געבעטהױז (ניט ייִדיש) (house of prayer, non-Jewish)

--
### An attempt to flatten Yiddish semantics into a single book
#### But also, perhaps, to create an automaton -- a paper machine that knows the language and can transmit it
##### A paper golem, if we may be so bold???

--
#### Questions of encoding
- the <em>Oytser</em> wants to compress all of Yiddish, but it is also a prescriptive work
- the editors have a concept of a <em>kulturshprakh</em>
	- international standard of Yiddish communication

--
#### Deviations

- ↓ (not recommended in the kulturshprakh)
- ° (not (yet) accepted in the kulturshprakh, mostly Slavic words)
- \* (vulgar expression)
- number of acronyms denoting proscribed origins 
	- e.g. [אמ] for Americanisms (which they oppose), [קל] for Klezmer-loshn

--
#### Encoded language planning
- In their intro, write about the encoding
- After the Holocaust, there is no possibility of Slavic languages "flooding" Yiddish, so they are to be used as an element for the "enrichment" of Yiddish
- Whereas English is too dangerous, threatens to overwhelm Yiddish entirely

--

e.g.

![oytser](images/instruments.png)<!-- .element height="500px;" -->

--
Interesting insights come from attending to the flattening of the Yiddish language

Perhaps most interesting: what was not allowed to be completely flattened? What had to be kept apart?

---

Ex. 2: Kotik's <em>Zhargonnyy Chitatel</em>

![zharg chitat](images/zharg.png)<!-- .element height="400px;" -->

<small>Cohen, Nathan. Yiddish Transformed: Reading Habits in the Russian Empire, 1860-1914. Translated by Rebecca Wolpe. New York, NY: Berghahn Books, 2023, 79</small>

--

#### Avrom Kotik
- Born ~1868 near Grodno, died in 1933
- Devoted socialist
- Scholar of Yiddish reading
- "He took an interest in the reading habits of those same Jews and dedicated many years of his life to widening the variety of what he considered quality Yiddish books and making them accessible." (Cohen, 76)
<br><br>
<small>All information on Kotik taken from Cohen's amazing <em>Yiddish Transformed</em>

--
#### Жаргонный читатель и его характеристика (The Jargon Reader and his Characteristics), 1902
- A study of Yiddish reading habits, including statistical study of a "provincial library"
	- Published in Еврейский Ежегодник, 1902, Saint Petersburg

--
#### Most popular authors

![zharg chitat](images/zharg.png)<!-- .element height="400px;" -->

--
#### Popularity of scientific literature
![zharg sci](images/zharg_sci.png)<!-- .element height="400px;" -->

---
#### 🚨 lehavdil alert 🚨

--
Ex. 3? Flattening in the Hebrew Bible?

![Joshua 12:9-24](images/joshua_leningrad.png)<!-- .element height="500px;" -->

<small>Joshua 12:9-24</small>

--

But this takes us too far afield...

---
### 2. Some projects of mine

![projects](images/projects.png)<!-- .element height="500px;" -->

--
#### Mapping Yiddish Publishing

![mapping yiddish publishing](images/mapping_yiddish_publishing.png)<!-- .element height="500px;" -->

--
#### Mapping Yiddish Publishing

- [Temporal map of Yiddish publishing](https://sreyfe.github.io/mapping_yiddish_publishing/)
	- Made from the digital collection of the Yiddish Book Center (13,000 items, not all of them books)

--
#### Technical details
- Written in JavaScript with [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), an open source JS library for interactive maps
- Data acquired via [archive.org's advanced search](https://archive.org/advancedsearch.php)
	- (might still be down)
	- You can use it to download a lot of data in a format like CSV or JSON
- Data then cleaned using [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/)
	- e.g. Varshe, Warsche, Warszawa → Warsaw
- Hosted on GitHub pages
	- [Code here](https://github.com/sreyfe/mapping_yiddish_publishing)


--
#### What is this for?

- Geographic reading of the Yiddish Book Center's data
- A flattening of Yiddish literature, a projection onto the world map
- Emphasizes places that might otherwise be lost
	- e.g. Buenos Aires production post-War

---
#### Random Forverts bot

![random forverts bot](images/random_forverts.png)<!-- .element height="500px;" -->

--

#### Random Forverts bot
- [X (Twitter) bot](https://x.com/random_forverts) which posts a random article from the [NLI's digitized Forverts](https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/frw/) every hour

- Also a [BlueSky version](https://bsky.app/profile/randomforverts.bsky.social) in the works!

--

#### Technical details
- Python bot built with [Tweepy](https://www.tweepy.org/)
- Hosted on DigitalOcean
	- would prefer GitHub pages, but you need a server for this
- NLI has an API, but it doesn't give access to their newspaper collection


--
#### Technical details
- But what they do have is a nice way of accessing individual articles using dates
	- https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/frw/<em>year</em>/<em>month</em>/<em>day</em>/01/article/<em>article</em>
	- https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/frw/1947/09/14/01/article/6

--
		<table style="width: 60%">
			<tr>
				<th>Year</th>
				<th>Month</th>
				<th>Day</th>
				<th>Article</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td id="year">&nbsp; </td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td id="url">https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/frw/<em>year</em>/<em>month</em>/<em>day</em>/01/article/<em>article</em></td>
				</tr>
		</table>

--
#### Technical details

- In reality, we use a slightly different URL which gives us a PDF
- Keep trying until we get one
	- Sometimes the URL leads to an article that doesn't exist
- The PDF is then converted to a PNG, then cropped, then posted

--
#### What is this for?

- Basically, a fun way to read the archive
- A means of stumbling upon Yiddish that might otherwise remain unread
- Randomness is a powerful tool!

---
#### Yiddish Corpus for DraCor

![yidracor](images/YiDraCor.png)<!-- .element height="500px;" -->

--

#### What is DraCor?

![DraCor frontpage as of 5 October 2024](images/dracor-frontpage-2024-10-05.png)

- Short for *drama corpora*, a growing collection of plays in (mostly) European languages, all encoded in TEI. 
- As of now, 25 DraCor corpora in 19 languages, almost 4,000 plays.
- DraCor also provides an interface for research into European drama from Greek antiquity to the 20th century.
- check it out: [**dracor.org**](https://dracor.org/)

<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.7em;" -->

--

#### YiDraCor

![yidracor plays](images/YiDraCor_plays.png)<!-- .element height="500px;" -->

--
#### TEI

![tei](images/TEI.png)<!-- .element height="500px" -->

--
#### Pipeline
1. OCR scans of plays
2. Correct OCR
3. Mark plaintext up with [ezdrama](https://github.com/dracor-org/ezdrama)
4. Out comes a TEI-encoded play!

--

#### Cool metrics
![yudale](images/YiDraCor.png)<!-- .element height="500px;" -->

--
#### Cool metrics cont.
![speech distributions](images/metrics.png)<!-- .element height="500px;" -->

--
#### Full texts available
![full text](images/full_text.png)<!-- .element height="500px;" -->

--
#### As well as other formats
![other formats](images/other_data.png)<!-- .element height="500px;" -->

--
#### But at its core, DraCor is not a website
- It is a programmable corpus, at its most powerful when interfaced via its API
	- API being a protocol by means of which particular data can be queried

--
#### API
![api](images/api.png)

--
#### What is this for?

- In 2024, DraCor has been used to
	- [sketch the scheming slave in Roman comedy](https://doi.org/10.48694/jcls.3670)
	- [investigate the German one-act play](https://doi.org/10.1515/9783111334059)
	- [analyze text reuse in theater of the Spanish Siglo de Oro](https://doi.org/10.13035/H.2024.12.01.10)

- Hopefully, more from YiDraCor soon!


---
### 3. [iberz.org](https://iberz.org/)
![iberz](images/iberz.png)

--
#### What is iberz?

- Database of translations into Yiddish
- Over 1,300 translations
	- texts from the Yiddish Book Center
- Over 1,200 source texts
- 34 different languages
- 814 authors
- 763 translators

--
#### [Let's take a look](https://iberz.org/)

![iberz](images/iberz.png)

--
#### Technical details

- data in two YAML files ([here](https://github.com/sreyfe/iberz_data))
	- one for translations, the other for source texts
- hosted on GitHub pages
- site constructed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
	- static site generator
	- with plugin [jekyll-datapage_gen](https://github.com/avillafiorita/jekyll-datapage_gen)
		- allows pages to be created with data in serialized format (JSON, YAML in my case)

--
#### From these:
![meyrink yaml](images/meyrink_yaml.png)

--
### To these:
![meyrink iberz](images/meyrink_iberz.png)

--

#### Motivation
- Yiddish translations are often inconsistently cataloged, or not at all
	- Generally with Yiddish, lots of data, not so much metadata!
- Goal: make a central repository with structured bibliographic metadata for translations into Yiddish

--
#### Process

- First step: manual annotation of the Yiddish Book Center's data
	- as taken from the Internet Archive
	- first round binary: whether or not likely translation
	- second round: annotation with other data

--

![spreadsheet](images/iberz_spreadsheet.png)<!-- .element height="500px;" -->

--
#### What is a translation?

- I don't know!
	- very tricky theoretical territory
	- line between translation and adaptation?
- Don't want to have to decide

--
#### Instead, a heuristic: Toury's "assumed translation"
<br>

<small>"any target-culture [in this case, Yiddish] text for which there are reasons to tentatively posit the existence of another text, in another culture/language, from which it was presumably derived by transfer operations and to which it is now tied by a set of relationships based on shared features, some of which may be regarded -- within the culture in question -- as necessary and/or sufficient."</small>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<small>Toury, Gideon. Descriptive Translation Studies – and Beyond. Btl.100. John Benjamins Publishing Company. Accessed October 13, 2023. https://benjamins.com/catalog/btl.100, 26.</small>

--

#### Processs

- This provides room for the wide range of translational activity by which Yiddish texts were derived from other texts
- Means that the method for creating the corpus was trying to find evidence of another text "from which it was presumably derived"

--

#### Sometimes easy

|<em>Madam Bovari fun Gustav Flober</em>|<em>Tevye der milkhiker fun Sholem Aleykhem</em>|
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|![bovari](images/bovari.jpg)<!-- .element height="400px;" -->|![tevye](images/tevye.jpg)<!-- .element height="400px;" -->|

--
#### Usually harder
- hopefully YBC is up tomorrow so I can add slides!

--
#### Most useful methods
- if author's name is present, finding bibliographies
	- often the name isn't present
- translating and googling passages
- googling character names
	- especially in Russian!
		- since there's more Russian on the internet than Yiddish, and Russian also uses phonetic transcription of names

---
#### What is this for?

- It is a bibliographical resource for all to use
- It lets us produce very interesting diagrams which tell us about the history of translation into Yiddish
- Its construction reveals secrets...

--
#### Example: what languages have been translated into Yiddish?

- 34 in the database
- <small>Russian (553 volumes), German (371),
English (253), Hebrew (226), French (226), Polish (77), Danish (40), Norwegian (36),
Aramaic (33), Swedish (21), Italian (20), Spanish (18), Ukrainian (15), Greek (8), Dutch
(8), Arabic (6), Belorussian (4), Romanian (4), Latin (4), Portuguese (3), Lithuanian (3),
Judao-Arabic (3), Czech (3), Bengali (3), Judaeo-German (2), Latvian (2), Japanese (2),
Hungarian (1), Sanskrit (1), Chinese (1), Georgian (1), Neapolitan (1), Farsi (1), Finnish
(1)</small>

--

#### Top languages (synchronic)
![source languages](images/source_languages_by_number_of_volumes.png)

--
#### But these change over time

![languages diachronic](images/popularity_of_top_5_languages.png)

--
#### Similar patterns in places of publication

![places diachronic](images/popularity_of_top_5_places.png)

--
#### Summary of figures
- Saddle points around the World Wars
- Catastrophe leads to reorganization of Yiddish translation
	- 1. New York, German
	- 2. Warsaw, Russian
	- 3. Buenos Aires, Hebrew

--
#### Lead to interesting questions, for example:
- Why does French translation increase steadily (but differently from Russian) in the interwar period?
- Why is this line so similar to the steady increase of Vilne during this period?

--
#### Questions
- Increase of French can be linked with Mark Rakovski, who translated a lot of French during the interwar period
	- had his own press
	- translated/published Flaubert (cf. Bovary above) Barbusse, Istrati, and Prevost
	- continued translating after WWII, two translations for <em>Yidish bukh</em>, neither in French

--
#### Questions
- Can this be linked to the rise of Vilne?
	- not immediately, since he published in Warsaw
	- much to consider...

--
#### Annotation process generates questions

- Annotation is not only a means to an end
	- end: some hypothetical state where you've perfectly captured everything
	- instead, it's an engine for textual discovery
- Precisely where annotation breaks down, this is where the most interesting things are found

--
#### Example: [Paskarella](https://iberz.org/id/ytd001076/) by Boccaccio(?)

![paskarella](images/paskarella.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--
#### Example: Paskarella by Boccaccio(?)
- Published in 1899 by B. Rabinovitts in New York
- Translated (or "<em>baarbet</em>," i.e. "adapted") by D. M. Hermalin
	- Exceedingly prolific translator/adapter
	- Popular in Kotik's provincial library
- Does not correspond to anything in Boccaccio's oeuvre
	- Nor does another supposed Boccaccio work: [<em>Madam babeta</em>](https://iberz.org/id/ytd000109/)

--
And yet they reappear in a 1927 English edition, published by Samuel Roth

![english paskarella](images/02-pasquerella-and-madonna-babetta.jpg)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--
#### Samuel Roth
![roth](images/roth.jpg)<!-- .element height="200px;" -->
- American publisher, born in Galicia in 1893
- Went to jail in the 1930's for pornography distribution
- Best known for publishing <em>Ulysses</em> without Joyce's consent

--
#### Samuel Roth
- Produced/published phony translations like:
	- 1941: <em>I Was Hitler’s Doctor</em>
	- 1951: <em>My Sister and I</em>, supposedly a lost work by Nietzsche
- It seems he turned to Yiddish popular literature, selected a pseudotranslation of Boccaccio, and once more passed it off as the genuine article

--
#### Doesn't necessary fit well into the annotation scheme

![paskarella iberz](images/paskarella_iberz.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--
#### How are anomalies annotated?

- With notes (as above)
- Also with keywords
	- not yet implemented on the front end

--
#### Keywords: <em>false attribution</em> and <em>probable pseudotranslation</em>

- Nine in total in the database
	- Including a misattribution of Mayne-Reid (as Verne), and an invented Tolstoy
	- Eight of which were published before WWI
	- Five of which were published by the infamous <em>Hebrew Publishing Company</em>

--
- This suggests certain translational practices prevalent in this era, and in particular by this publisher
	- Very adaptive translational norm
	- Borne out in close reading
		- e.g. a Verne translation (<em>Di ferlorene shif</em>, Tanenboym)
			- significantly expands chapter on Australia for political reasons

--
### Elliptical reading
- Moving back and forth between the close and the distant
	- using the movement to produce a deeper image of the subject
