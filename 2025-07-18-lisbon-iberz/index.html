## Introducing <em>iberz</em>, a database of Yiddish translations
Jonah Lubin, Frank Fischer<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em;" -->

--
#### What is iberz?

- Database of translations into Yiddish
- Over 1,300 translations
	- texts from the Yiddish Book Center
- Over 1,200 source texts
- 34 different languages
- 814 authors
- 763 translators

--
#### Database + Web App

[![iberz](images/iberz.png)](https://iberz.org/)

--
#### Technical overview

- data in two YAML files ([here](https://github.com/sreyfe/iberz_data))
	- one for translations, the other for source texts
- hosted on GitHub pages
- web app constructed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
	- static site generator
	- with plugin [jekyll-datapage_gen](https://github.com/avillafiorita/jekyll-datapage_gen)
		- allows pages to be created with data in serialized format (JSON, YAML in my case)

--
#### Minimal computing
- Inspired by the work of Gimena del Rio Riande
	- Very helpful
- Static site, not a costly relational database
- Data stored in two  YAML's which link to each other
	- Pseudo-relational
	- Can be hosted staticly

#### Motivation
- Yiddish translations are often inconsistently cataloged, or not at all
	- Generally with Yiddish, lots of data, not so much metadata!
- Goal: make a central repository with structured bibliographic metadata for translations into Yiddish

--
#### Process

- First step: manual annotation of the Yiddish Book Center's data
	- as taken from the Internet Archive
	- first round binary: whether or not likely translation
	- second round: annotation with other data

--
#### What is a translation?

- I don't know!
	- very tricky theoretical territory
	- line between translation and adaptation?
- Don't want to have to decide

--
#### Instead, a heuristic: Toury's "assumed translation"
<br>

<small>"any target-culture [in this case, Yiddish] text for which there are reasons to tentatively posit the existence of another text, in another culture/language, from which it was presumably derived by transfer operations and to which it is now tied by a set of relationships based on shared features, some of which may be regarded -- within the culture in question -- as necessary and/or sufficient."</small>

<small>Toury, Gideon. Descriptive Translation Studies – and Beyond. Btl.100. John Benjamins Publishing Company. Accessed October 13, 2023. https://benjamins.com/catalog/btl.100, 26.</small>

--

#### Processs

- This provides room for the wide range of translational activity by which Yiddish texts were derived from other texts
- Means that the method for creating the corpus was trying to find evidence of another text "from which it was presumably derived"

--

#### Sometimes easy

#### Usually harder

--
#### Most useful methods
- if author's name is present, finding bibliographies
	- often the name isn't present
- translating and googling passages
- googling character names
	- especially in Russian!
		- since there's more Russian on the internet than Yiddish, and Russian also uses phonetic transcription of names

---
#### What is this for?

- It is a bibliographical resource for all to use
- It lets us produce very interesting diagrams which tell us about the history of translation into Yiddish
- Its construction reveals secrets...

--
#### Example: what languages have been translated into Yiddish?

- 34 in the database
- <small>Russian (553 volumes), German (371),
English (253), Hebrew (226), French (226), Polish (77), Danish (40), Norwegian (36),
Aramaic (33), Swedish (21), Italian (20), Spanish (18), Ukrainian (15), Greek (8), Dutch
(8), Arabic (6), Belorussian (4), Romanian (4), Latin (4), Portuguese (3), Lithuanian (3),
Judao-Arabic (3), Czech (3), Bengali (3), Judaeo-German (2), Latvian (2), Japanese (2),
Hungarian (1), Sanskrit (1), Chinese (1), Georgian (1), Neapolitan (1), Farsi (1), Finnish
(1)</small>

#### Top languages (synchronic)
![source languages](images/source_languages_by_number_of_volumes.png)

--
#### But these change over time

![languages diachronic](images/popularity_of_top_5_languages.png)

--
#### Similar patterns in places of publication

![places diachronic](images/popularity_of_top_5_places.png)

--
#### Aligns with crisis around the world wars

![total translations](images/total_translations.png)

--
#### Summary of figures
- Saddle points around the World Wars
- Catastrophe leads to reorganization of Yiddish translation
	- 1. New York, German
	- 2. Warsaw, Russian
	- 3. Buenos Aires, Hebrew

--
#### Interesting!
- But the database is useful not only to see these big patterns
- It also reveals anomolous entities

--
#### Annotation process generates questions

- Annotation is not only a means to an end
	- end: some hypothetical state where you've perfectly captured everything
	- instead, it's an engine for textual discovery
- Precisely where annotation breaks down, this is where the most interesting things are found

--
#### Example: [Paskarella](https://iberz.org/id/ytd001076/) by Boccaccio(?)

![paskarella](images/paskarella.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--
#### Example: Paskarella by Boccaccio(?)
- Published in 1899 by B. Rabinovitts in New York
- Translated (or "<em>baarbet</em>," i.e. "adapted") by D. M. Hermalin
	- Exceedingly prolific translator/adapter
	- Popular in Kotik's provincial library
- Does not correspond to anything in Boccaccio's oeuvre
	- Nor does another supposed Boccaccio work: [<em>Madam babeta</em>](https://iberz.org/id/ytd000109/)

--
And yet they reappear in a 1927 English edition, published by Samuel Roth

![english paskarella](images/02-pasquerella-and-madonna-babetta.jpg)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--
#### Samuel Roth
![roth](images/roth.jpg)<!-- .element height="200px;" -->
- American publisher, born in Galicia in 1893
- Went to jail in the 1930's for pornography distribution
- Best known for publishing <em>Ulysses</em> without Joyce's consent

--
#### Samuel Roth
- Produced/published phony translations like:
	- 1941: <em>I Was Hitler’s Doctor</em>
	- 1951: <em>My Sister and I</em>, supposedly a lost work by Nietzsche
- It seems he turned to Yiddish popular literature, selected a pseudotranslation of Boccaccio, and once more passed it off as the genuine article

--
#### Doesn't necessary fit well into the annotation scheme

![paskarella iberz](images/paskarella_iberz.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--
#### How are anomalies annotated?

- With notes (as above)
- Also with keywords
	- not yet implemented on the front end

--
#### Keywords: <em>false attribution</em> and <em>probable pseudotranslation</em>

- Nine in total in the database
	- Including a misattribution of Mayne-Reid (as Verne), and an invented Tolstoy
	- Eight of which were published before WWI
	- Five of which were published by the infamous <em>Hebrew Publishing Company</em>

--
- This suggests certain translational practices prevalent in this era, and in particular by this publisher
	- Very adaptive translational norm
	- Borne out in close reading
		- e.g. a Verne translation (<em>Di ferlorene shif</em>, Tanenboym)
			- significantly expands chapter on Australia for political reasons

--
### Elliptical reading
- Moving back and forth between the close and the distant
	- using the movement to produce a deeper image of the subject
