## Introducing <em>iberz</em>, a database of Yiddish translations
Jonah Lubin (Harvard University), Frank Fischer (Freie Universität Berlin)<!-- .element: style="font-size:0.8em;" -->

--
#### What is iberz?

- Database of translations into Yiddish
- Over 1,300 translations
	- texts from the Yiddish Book Center
- Over 1,200 source texts
- 29 different languages
- 814 authors
- 763 translators

--
#### Database + Web App ([iberz.org](https://iberz.org))

[![iberz](images/iberz.png)](https://iberz.org/)

--
#### Technical overview

- data in two YAML files ([here](https://github.com/sreyfe/iberz_data))
	- one for translations, the other for source texts
- hosted on GitHub pages
- web app constructed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
	- static site generator
	- with plugin [jekyll-datapage_gen](https://github.com/avillafiorita/jekyll-datapage_gen)
		- allows pages to be created with data in serialized format (JSON, YAML in my case)

--
#### Minimal computing
- Inspired by the work of Gimena del Rio Riande
	- Very helpful
- Static site, not a costly relational database
- Data stored in two  YAML's which link to each other
	- Pseudo-relational
	- Can be hosted staticly

#### Source as static page

--
#### Info combined on (fuzzy) search page
![bovari search page](images/search_page.png)

---
#### Motivation
- Yiddish translations are often inconsistently cataloged, or not at all
	- Generally with Yiddish, lots of data, not so much metadata!
- Goal: make a central repository with structured bibliographic metadata for translations into Yiddish

--
#### Process

- First step: manual annotation of the Yiddish Book Center's data
	- as taken from the Internet Archive
- Identify translations

--
#### But what is a translation?

- I don't know!
	- very tricky theoretical territory
	- line between translation and adaptation?
- Don't want to have to decide

--
#### Instead, a heuristic: Toury's "assumed translation"
<br>

<small>"any target-culture [in this case, Yiddish] text for which there are reasons to tentatively posit the existence of another text, in another culture/language, from which it was presumably derived by transfer operations and to which it is now tied by a set of relationships based on shared features, some of which may be regarded -- within the culture in question -- as necessary and/or sufficient."</small>

<small>Toury, Gideon. Descriptive Translation Studies – and Beyond. Btl.100. John Benjamins Publishing Company. Accessed October 13, 2023. https://benjamins.com/catalog/btl.100, 26.</small>

--

#### Processs

- This provides room for the wide range of translational activity by which Yiddish texts were derived from other texts
- Means that the method for creating the corpus was trying to find evidence of another text "from which it was presumably derived"

--

#### Sometimes easy

#### Usually harder

#### What is <em>iberz</em>  for?

- It is a bibliographical resource for all to use
- It lets us give numerical answers to questions about translation into Yiddish
- Its construction reveals secrets...

--
#### Example: what languages have been translated into Yiddish?

- 29 in the database
- <small>
Russian (463), German (361), English (237), French (190), Hebrew (177), Polish (71), Danish (34), Norwegian (28), Italian (20), Swedish (18), Spanish (16), Ukrainian (13), Greek (7), Dutch (7), Arabic (6), Latin (4), Romanian (3), Portuguese (3), Czech (3), Judaeo-Arabic (3), Aramaic (2), Judaeo-German (2), Lithuanian (1), Hungarian (1), Sanskrit (1), Georgian (1), Belorussian (1), Neapolitan (1), Finnish (1)

#### But top 5 change over time

#### Similar patterns in places of publication

--
#### Aligns with crisis around the world wars

![total translations](images/total_translations.png)

--
#### Summary of figures
- Saddle points around the World Wars
- Catastrophe leads to reorganization of Yiddish translation

--
#### Interesting!
- But the database is useful not only to see these big patterns
- It also reveals anomolous entities

--
#### Annotation process generates questions

- Annotation is not only a means to an end
	- it's also an engine for textual discovery
- Precisely where the annotation breaks down is where things get interesting


---
#### Example: [Paskarella](https://iberz.org/id/ytd001076/) by Boccaccio(?)

![paskarella](images/paskarella.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--
#### Example: Paskarella by Boccaccio(?)
- Published in 1899 by B. Rabinovitts in New York
- Translated (or "<em>baarbet</em>," i.e. "adapted") by D. M. Hermalin
	- Exceedingly prolific translator/adapter
- Does not correspond to anything in Boccaccio's oeuvre
- Pseudotranslation!

--
And yet it reappears in a 1927 English edition, published by Samuel Roth

![english paskarella](images/02-pasquerella-and-madonna-babetta.jpg)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--
#### Samuel Roth
![roth](images/roth.jpg)<!-- .element height="200px;" -->
- American publisher, born in Galicia in 1893
- Best known for publishing <em>Ulysses</em> without Joyce's consent
- Translates this Yiddish pseudotranslation into English, passes it off again

--
#### Here the annotation scheme breaks down a little

- Can't quite capture this very strange book and its afterlife
- So how do we annotate this?
	- Imperfectly:
		- With a "notes" section
		- And with keywords

--
#### Keywords: <em>false attribution</em> and <em>probable pseudotranslation</em>

- Nine in total in the database
	- Including a misattribution of Mayne-Reid (as Verne), and an invented Tolstoy
	- Eight of these were published before WWI
	- Five of which were published by the infamous <em>Hebrew Publishing Company</em>

--
- This suggests certain translational practices prevalent in this era and from this publisher
	- Very adaptive translational norm
