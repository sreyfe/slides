## YiDraCor
Jonah Lubin, Ruthie Abeliovich, Sinai Rusinek,
Stephan Schwarz, Parker Robbins

--
#### State of the Corpus

- Eight plays
- Date range: 1887-1918
- Three authors
	- Joseph Lateiner, Jane Rose, Sholem Aleichem

--
#### Origins

- Began at [DraCor Onboarding Workshop for Hebrew and Yiddish](https://www.ada.fu-berlin.de/en/kalender/HeDraCorWorkshop.html)
	- September 2023
	- When Ruthie Abeliovich and Sinai Rusinek came to the FU
- Proceeds out of the DYBBUK project

--

#### DYBBUK project
![DYBBUK](images/dybbuk.jpg)<!-- .element height="150px;" -->
- Project hosted at the University of Haifa and Tel Aviv University
- Ruthie Abeliovich is PI, Sinai Rusinek is DH consultant
- Focuses on Yiddish popular theater between 1880-1920

--

#### Origins
- Started out by looking at plays by Joseph Lateiner (1853 â€“ 1935)
	- Wrote the eponymous <em>Dybbuk</em> of the DYBBUK project
	- Very popular, but seen as low brow and mostly forgotten
	- Active in Bucharest in New York

--

#### Lateiner

---

## Round One
- The first three plays

--

#### Converting Lateiner
- Began with printed Lateiner material archived by Polona
	- Firstly, <em>Der man untern tish</em>

![man_untern_tish](images/man_untern_tish.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--

#### OCR'd using Transkribus using Sinai's Yidrama model

![untern tish transkribus](images/untern_tish_transkribus.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--

#### But there are orthography problems...

- These editions used an older, highly vocalized, Germanizing orthography that the model wasn't picking up
- It's important to maintain varied Yiddish orthography and not silently "correct" it (my claim)

--

#### There followed a long manual annotation process

- Correcting OCR errors, adding back the points it missed
- Then (script-assisted) annotation with EZDrama
- Ultimately resulting in good TEI

--

#### But Stephan Schwarz did it better...

- Working on the longer Lateiner play <em>Yudale der blinder</em>
- Used already-corrected pages as ground truth, used this to automatically correct unseen pages
- Then did some spot correction with this table

--

#### Beautiful table

![correction table](images/correction_table.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--

#### Beautiful pipeline
- This pipeline ([more here](https://github.com/esteeschwarz/ETCRA5_dd23/blob/master/dybbuk/README.md)) is one of the few descriptions of this sort of Yiddish orthography
	- And certainly the only digital description
- Orthographic description as script

--

#### So generally speaking, this was the process for the first round:

1. Transkribus OCR of PDF's from Polona and Yiddish Book Center
2. Correction
3. EZDrama annotation
4. Finalize TEI

---

## Round Two
- Five plays more

--

#### Unlike some other languages...
- There are very few online full texts in Yiddish
	- no Proyekt Yidnburg (yet)
- So there isn't much HTML lying around to convert to TEI XML

--

#### Luckily, Refoyel Finkl exists

![finkl](images/finkl.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--

#### Refoyel Finkl
- UKentucky CompSci professor, has been doing Yiddish DH for a long time
- Has many resources on his site
	- His own dictionary, a digitization of Stutchkoff's <em>Oytser</em>
- And importantly, a digital edition of the complete works of Sholem Aleichem
	- Which he let us get our hands on

--

#### Includes five plays
![complete works](images/complete_works.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--

#### Look like this
![finkl site](images/finkl_site.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--

#### In pretty comprehensive HTML
![finkl html](images/finkl_html.png)

--

#### Which can be converted with Python + a few libraries
![html to tei](images/html_to_tei.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--

## Et voila! Add in some metadata and you've got five more plays

---

## Round Three
- The future

--

#### This brings us up to the present day...
- But first, some backstory

--

#### The DYBBUK project has done a lot of annotation
- Of handwritten prompting notebooks from Lateiner plays
- Scripts, more or less

--

#### Looks like this
![prompting notebook](images/notebook.png)<!-- .element height="450px;" -->

--

#### We are now working on converting these to TEI XML
- In particular, Parker Robbins of UChicago is building a pipeline
- I'll say no more, because we'll be presenting on this soon...

---

### That's more or less where we are right now
- One last thing before I go

--

#### \<foreign\> tag

- General, philosophical question: what is "foreign" in a language?
- Exacerbated by Yiddish's mixedness
	- Semitic, Slavic elements
	- Background of polyglossia

--

#### \<foreign\> tag

- When is a Hebraism/Slavicism a "part of the language," when should it be seen as an "intrusion"?
	- Provisionally solved by question "is it in the dictionaries?"
		- Unsatisfying

--

#### \<foreign\> tag

- How should we classify mixed utterances, or utterances hard to classify to single national language
	- e.g. Hebrew-Aramaic mixture (<em>loshn-koydesh</em>)
	- e.g. Polish-Ukrainian-Russian mixture and uncertainty
- Non iso tags?
	- `<foreign xml:lang="slav">`
	- `<foreign xml:lang="loshn-koydesh">`
